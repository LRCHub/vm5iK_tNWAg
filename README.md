[00:28.67] Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
[00:35.67] Thought I heard you talking softly
[00:42.14] I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio
[00:49.07] Still I can't escape the ghost of you
[01:07.57] 
[00:56.07] What has happened to it all?
[00:59.18] Crazy, some'd say
[01:02.73] Where is the life that I recognize? (Gone away)
[01:26.23] 
[01:10.53] But I won't cry for yesterday
[01:13.98] There's an ordinary world
[01:17.46] Somehow I have to find
[01:24.02] And as I try to make my way
[01:27.67] To the ordinary world
[01:31.12] I will learn to survive
[01:42.62] 
[01:44.26] Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
[01:50.90] "Pride will tear us both apart"
[01:56.47] Well, now pride's gone out the window
[02:00.43] Cross the rooftops, run away
[02:04.66] Left me in the vacuum of my heart
[02:21.16] 
[02:11.36] What is happening to me?
[02:14.81] Crazy, some'd say
[02:18.49] Where is my friend when I need you most? (Gone away)
[02:44.49] 
[02:25.83] But I won't cry for yesterday
[02:29.43] There's an ordinary world
[02:32.87] Somehow I have to find
[02:39.62] And as I try to make my way
[02:43.14] To the ordinary world
[02:46.54] I will learn to survive
[02:58.04] 
[02:54.73] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[02:58.59] Ahh-ah-ahh
[03:05.29] Away-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
[03:12.99] Oh, oh
[03:15.99] 
[03:20.16] Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
[03:26.96] Fear today, forgot tomorrow
[03:32.63] Ooh-ooh
[03:33.24] Here besides the news of holy war and holy need
[03:40.44] Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
[03:57.94] 
[04:15.22] And I don't cry for yesterday
[04:19.17] There's an ordinary world
[04:22.39] Somehow I have to find
[04:29.30] And as I try to make my way
[04:32.95] To the ordinary world
[04:36.41] I will learn to survive
[04:47.91] 
[04:41.37] (Every world is my world)
[04:50.17] I will learn to survive
[04:55.17] (Any world is my world)
[05:03.77] I will learn to survive
[05:08.63] (Any world is my world)
[05:22.31] (Every world is my world)
